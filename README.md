## How To Run
Open the "MovieApp" folder in VScode and open a terminal. Then type "ng serve" and wait for the localhost server to launch (the default address is http://localhost:4200/. However, there will also be a popup that you can ctrl+click to open the website).

## Navigation
The website's functionality is simple. 

To access a movie you click on it. 

There is a search bar in the top right that will search on pressing the enter key. If nothing is entered it will go back to the home page (this can also be accessed by clicking "Movie App" in the top left). 

A user can login by clicking the top right and can register by clicking the register button at the bottom of the login page. 

This is later replaced with an account page when logged in. The account page is used to select which of the 5 supported subscription services the user has. This is then displayed on the movie page in order of colour. The colour meanings can be seen by hovering over a subscription service. Here is a description of the colours and their meanings: red means the movie does not show on that platform, yellow means it does but the user does not have a subscription to that service, and green means it is on that streaming service and the user has a subscription.
